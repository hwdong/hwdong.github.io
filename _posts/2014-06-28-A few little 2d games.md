 I am tired of reading papers. In 2014 summer,I suddenly want to write little games running on Android. So I learned how to programm on Android first day and wrote a few little 2d games in the next week. Here are the three games which can be run on PC,Android.(I didn't provide the downloads for iphone and ipad). For web version, I recommand you to open them with [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

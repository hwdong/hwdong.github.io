I implemented three 3d non-rigid registration algorithms besed on different deformation techniques.

It seems the older DT algorithm is better than two other newer algorithms (ASAP and ED). In the figure 2, algorithm1(ASAP), algorithm2(ED), algorithm3(DT) are compaired. 



My 3d registration program can be downloaded [here](http://hwdong.com/3dRegister.zip).

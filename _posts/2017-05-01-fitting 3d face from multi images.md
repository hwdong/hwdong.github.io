If We have multi face images,we can get better 3d face fitting. There are still some problems in the resulted model. We can improve the result later. Please wait ...

Note: Because We want a 3d face model with open eye,the two eye and nose hole are automatically erased in the images before fitting. 

从多张图像可以得到更好的3d人脸拟合结果，当然很明显其中还是存在一些问题，请耐心等待后续改进版本...(当人们5.1出门旅游时，我正在家写程序,不过现在很懒了(如同作家写文章一样懒得动笔)，经常一周只写十几行或代码)
